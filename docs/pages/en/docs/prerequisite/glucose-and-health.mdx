## Glucose and Health

Glucose, a simple sugar with the molecular formula $C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}$, is the most prevalent monosaccharide and a crucial component of carbohydrates. It serves as a primary energy source for the body, particularly for the brain and muscles. The concentration of glucose in the blood, often referred to as blood sugar level, blood glucose level, or glycemia, is tightly regulated by the body to maintain metabolic homeostasis.

Maintaining appropriate blood glucose levels is vital for the normal functioning of various tissues. For instance, the human brain, which is highly dependent on glucose, utilizes approximately 60% of the glucose present in the bloodstream during periods of fasting and inactivity. This energy supply is essential for cognitive functions, mood regulation, and overall mental health.

However, when blood glucose levels remain elevated over prolonged periods, a condition known as hyperglycemia occurs. This can lead to glucose toxicity, which adversely affects cellular function and contributes to the development of serious health complications, particularly in individuals with diabetes. These complications may include cardiovascular disease, nerve damage, kidney dysfunction, and vision problems. Therefore, it is crucial for individuals, especially those at risk for diabetes, to monitor and manage their blood glucose levels effectively to promote overall health and prevent long-term complications.
