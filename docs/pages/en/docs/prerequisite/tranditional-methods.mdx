## General

Blood glucose measurement has various methods based on factors such as sample source, detection, and data collection.

For example, glucose or glycated hemoglobin can be measured through blood samples, while glucose can also be measured through urine or breath. The source and type of blood can lead to differences in implementation, such as measuring whole blood using a biochemical analyzer or measuring fingertip blood using a glucose meter.

However, many of these methods share similar chemical principles and can be mainly divided into: enzymatic methods and general chemical methods. Furthermore, due to the different measurement methods of chemical components, different chemical methods can be categorized into electrochemical methods, which use electrodes to measure concentration, and photochemical methods, which use photometers to measure concentration.

Currently, the more mainstream methods are based on enzymatic chemistry: Hexokinase method (HXK), Glucose oxidase method (GOX), and Glucose dehydrogenase method (GDH). Detailed chemical mechanisms will be discussed later.

General chemical methods include: alkaline copper reduction methods (Folin-Wu, Benedict, Nelson-Somogyi, Neocuproine, Shaeffer–Hartmann–Somogyi), alkaline ferricyanide reduction method (Hagedorn–Jensen), and condensation methods (Ortho-toluidine, Anthrone).

The main process of traditional methods includes: sampling, separation, reaction, and measurement, where self-testing can omit the separation step. Currently, the standard for blood glucose measurement is based on enzymatic methods with blood sampling.

## Limitations

Traditional methods have several shortcomings, such as:

* Invasive sampling: Collecting blood samples by puncturing the skin is an invasive procedure that may cause discomfort to patients.
* Complex processes: Some early blood glucose measurement devices are complicated to operate and require professional personnel, which is not conducive to self-monitoring by patients. The reagents and devices are relatively complex and can be affected by changes in reagents.
* Large sample volume: Early devices required a larger volume of blood samples, which may be inconvenient for patients who need frequent monitoring.
* Isolated information: Due to the process and sample volume, only a limited amount of data can be obtained at specific time points, which is not conducive to comprehensive monitoring.
