## Continuous Glucose Monitor(CGM)

A continuous glucose monitor, or CGM, is a handy tool that keeps track of your blood sugar levels throughout the day and night. It's like having a mini lab on your body that gives you real-time updates on your blood sugar, instead of having to prick your finger every time you want to check. This is especially useful for people with diabetes who need to keep a close eye on their blood sugar levels, whether they have type 1, type 2, or gestational diabetes.

## Brief Composition

A CGM is made up of three parts:

1. A tiny electrode that sits just under your skin.
2. A transmitter that regularly sends data from the electrode to a receiver (every 1 to 15 minutes).
3. A separate receiver that displays your blood sugar level.

CGMs use a special technology that reacts with the sugar molecules in your body fluids(interstitial fluid) to generate a signal. This signal is proportional to the amount of sugar in your body, and the data is then sent to the receiver for display. Most CGMs currently employ an electrochemical method based on enzymatic chemistry, measuring blood sugar by collecting the changes in electrical current caused by the reaction through the electrode.

Some CGMs need to be calibrated with traditional blood sugar tests, but others don't require any calibration by the user.

## Usage Process

1. You insert a small sensor just under your skin, usually on your abdomen or arm. An applicator makes this part quick and easy. An adhesive patch secures the sensor in place.
2. You either connect the CGM transmitter to the sensor, or the sensor and transmitter are already connected upon insertion. You may need to charge certain transmitters before connecting them to the sensor. You might also want to place additional adhesive on the transmitter and sensor to keep them in position on your skin.
3. Depending on the type of CGM, there will be a "warm-up" time before the sensor starts sharing data. This time typically ranges from 30 to 120 minutes.
4. Most CGMs will automatically start sharing glucose data after the warm-up period. Some require user calibration before they begin sharing data.
5. You will then see your current glucose levels on a smartphone app, receiver, or insulin pump until the sensor expires. You can set certain alerts and settings on the app, receiver, or pump to notify you when your glucose levels are out of range. These ranges vary from person to person.
6. Once the sensor expires (or fails), you will restart this process.

## Applicability 

* All type 1 diabetes patients and type 2 diabetes patients requiring intensive insulin therapy;
* Diabetes patients with significant blood sugar fluctuations and irregular blood sugar changes;
* Patients experiencing unexplained severe hypoglycemia or recurrent hypoglycemia, asymptomatic hypoglycemia, and nocturnal hypoglycemia;
* Unexplained hyperglycemia, especially fasting hyperglycemia, and patients who fear hypoglycemia or intentionally maintain high blood sugar;
* Gestational diabetes or diabetes in pregnancy;
* Children suspected of having diabetes or children with significant blood sugar fluctuations;
* Patients with gastroparesis, special types of diabetes, endocrine diseases with blood sugar changes, or those requiring continuous glucose monitoring.

## Benefits

CGMs are becoming more popular for several reasons:

1. Traditional fingerstick tests only give you a snapshot of your blood sugar at one point in time. CGMs, on the other hand, provide a continuous stream of data, showing you trends over time.
2. CGMs are more convenient and less painful than traditional fingerstick testing.
3. Some studies have shown that people who use CGMs spend less time with low blood sugar or with lower glycated hemoglobin, both of which are good news for your health.

CGMs seem to be more effective at lowering hemoglobin A1c levels (a measure of long-term blood sugar control) than just monitoring with traditional blood tests, especially when used by people with poorly controlled diabetes and in combination with an insulin pump. However, some research has found mixed results about the effectiveness of CGMs in children, adults, and those with poorly controlled diabetes.
