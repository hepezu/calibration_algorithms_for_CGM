## Linear Model

A linear model is fitted using data from two or more points.

## Limitations

This method is simple and stable, but it does not take into account the potential drift of the electrochemical probe, requiring regular recalibration (unless the CGM device is overall very robust, factory calibration cannot be achieved).
