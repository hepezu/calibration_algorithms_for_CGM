Diabetes is a major threat to human health, and continuously understanding blood sugar levels is an important part of daily life for people with diabetes. As our understanding of blood sugar deepens, more non-diabetic individuals are also beginning to pay attention to their own blood sugar levels.

The prerequisite for managing blood sugar is measuring it, and traditional laboratory methods are complex to implement. With the continuous development of self-monitoring methods, it has become possible to obtain one's blood sugar information in a timely manner at home. However, blood glucose meter testing still has drawbacks such as pain and complexity. The continuous glucose monitor (CGM), which emerged decades ago, is a revolutionary technology that allows individuals, especially those with diabetes, to continuously monitor their blood sugar levels.

The OpenCGM project aims to provide the public and professionals with information about blood glucose measurement, particularly related to CGM, including information on hardware, software, and more.

In this manual, you will learn about:
- The basics of blood glucose measurement
- The fundamentals of CGM technology
- The hardware, software, principles, and product roadmap for CGM
- How to process and analyze data collected from CGM devices, and various algorithms for calibrating CGM devices
- Practical steps for using the code provided in this project

Let's get started!
